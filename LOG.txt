		readEK80
		makeSonarNetCDF
		testNetCDF


	readEK80 is a function that reads the .raw file from Simrad EK80 and construct the information into a dataframe. This dataframe can then be used for further processing
	The datastructure may change in the future after proper testing and after other equipment, i.e. SU90, EK60, MS70, has been added. 


	makeSonarNetCDF is a function that reads the dataframe output from the reader and write the information to a netcdf file. 
	This netcdf file follows the definintion given by the ICES. 
	At current state, the maker function only make the structure of the netcdf data, but add no data into it. 


	testNetCDF is a function to test if the netcdf file is correct according to the ICES standard. 
	This function will be further modified as the makeSonarNetCDF are being modified.
